# Creating-WebMap-with-python-and-folium
Python &amp; Folium
a web map is a map that is displayed through a browser and can be visited

through the web, so this map was built with Python and Folium. Folium is a Python

library and the map has three layers. It has a base map layer, the one that you see

here with these names on the back and it has a polygon layer which represents the

population of the countries and also we have this point layer here with this

dots and you can turn on and off these layers. You also have these pop-up windows.
